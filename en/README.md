## ‚úçÔ∏è **Introduction**

Semiconductor technology began with the **invention of the transistor** and rapidly evolved with the advent of the **MOS structure**.  
**Miniaturization and integration** have progressed in line with Moore‚Äôs Law, and LSIs have penetrated all fields.

However, **fundamental areas such as physics, circuits, processes, and testing** are often fragmented in educational contexts.  
In practice, these are closely connected‚Äî**circuits depend on device physics, and design is supported by process technology and reliability**.

**Edusemi** focuses on the **structural connections between fundamental technologies**, fostering **structural understanding** with an eye toward applications.

> üí° **Design follows physics, and productization follows verification.**  
> Visualizing the connection from *physics ‚Üí circuits ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí verification*.
