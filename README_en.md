# 🎓 Edusemi-v4x: Foundational Educational Materials for Semiconductor Product Development

✍️ **Introduction**

The evolution of semiconductor technology began with the invention of the transistor and rapidly accelerated with the advent of the MOS structure.  
Driven by Moore's Law, miniaturization and integration have enabled the proliferation of LSI across all industries.

However, in the real world of engineering, disciplines such as **materials science, circuit design, process technology, and testing** are often taught in isolation.  
In practice, these fields are **closely interconnected**—circuit behavior relies on device physics, and design feasibility depends on process capabilities and reliability.

**Edusemi** addresses this gap by focusing on the **structural interconnections between foundational technologies**.  
While maintaining awareness of advanced applications, the emphasis remains on cultivating a **deep, structural understanding** of core semiconductor technologies—making the knowledge immediately useful in real-world development.
