Comparative analysis suggests that while DRAM maintains superior endurance and lowest write energy at extreme speed, FeRAM provides a compelling path to combine non-volatility with ns-class access. The volatile--non-volatile boundary is blurring as device and system innovations progress. Open problems include statistical variability in HfO$_2$ ferroelectrics, long-term retention at elevated temperature, and technology-circuit co-optimization.
