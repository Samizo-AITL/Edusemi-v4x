In conclusion, DRAM will continue to dominate high-performance volatile memory, while FeRAM provides a compelling path toward embedded non-volatile solutions~\cite{noheda2023}. 
Nevertheless, scaling challenges and device reliability remain open questions, as emphasized in recent reviews~\cite{martin2020}.
