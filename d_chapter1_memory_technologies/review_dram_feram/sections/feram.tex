Ferroelectric hafnia enabled non volatile switching compatible with logic processes. FeFET cells integrate a ferroelectric layer in the gate stack. Challenges include retention, variability, fatigue, and time dependent dielectric breakdown. Recent reports show endurance approaching 1e12 cycles with retention improvements.
