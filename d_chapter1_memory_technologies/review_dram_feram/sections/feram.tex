The HfO$_2$-based ferroelectric breakthrough enabled fast non-volatile operation with CMOS-friendly integration. FeFET cells (1T) drastically reduce footprint while offering ns-class switching. Key challenges include polarization variability, fatigue, retention, and TDDB. Emerging directions combine HfO$_2$ ferroelectrics with flexible substrates and 2D semiconductors, and explore radiation tolerance for extreme environments.
