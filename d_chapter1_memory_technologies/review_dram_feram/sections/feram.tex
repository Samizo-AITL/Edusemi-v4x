The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films~\cite{boscke2011} revitalized FeRAM research, enabling aggressive scaling and compatibility with CMOS back-end processes. 
FeFET devices integrate ferroelectric layers directly into the gate stack, offering non-volatile operation with near-DRAM speed~\cite{mueller2012}. 
Nevertheless, challenges persist in retention, fatigue, and variability, especially under scaled dimensions~\cite{schenk2015, kim2020_fefet}. 
Recent progress has improved endurance beyond $10^{12}$ cycles and enhanced retention stability in scaled FeFETs~\cite{li2022}. 
Reliability studies further emphasize the role of defect generation and TDDB under high-field operation~\cite{park2019_tddb}.
Despite progress, device variability~\cite{kim2020_fefet} and TDDB-related degradation~\cite{park2019_tddb} 
remain major reliability bottlenecks. 
Endurance improvements beyond $10^{12}$ cycles~\cite{li2022} suggest promising scaling paths, 
though retention degradation under aggressive field stress continues to be investigated~\cite{schenk2015}.
