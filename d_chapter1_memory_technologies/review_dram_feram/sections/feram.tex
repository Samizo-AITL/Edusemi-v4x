The HfO$_2$-based ferroelectric breakthrough enabled fast non-volatile operation with CMOS-friendly integration. 
FeFET cells (1T) drastically reduce footprint while offering in-class switching. 
Key challenges include polarization variability, fatigue, retention, and TDDB---especially under scaled dimensions.
Recent directions combine HfO$_2$ ferroelectrics with flexible substrates and explore radiation tolerance for extreme environments.
