The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films~\cite{boscke2011, mueller2012} revitalized FeRAM research. 
However, retention and endurance degradation remain critical challenges~\cite{schenk2015}. 
Recent device engineering has shown improved endurance and data retention in scaled FeFETs~\cite{li2022}.
