DRAM technology has continually advanced through cell capacitor scaling, high-$k$ dielectrics, and process innovations. 
Recent works highlight the difficulty of maintaining capacitance while suppressing leakage currents in deep sub-20 nm technologies~\cite{choi2022}. 
Furthermore, the industry is exploring 3D DRAM architectures to extend scaling, analogous to NAND flash, by stacking capacitor arrays~\cite{kim2021_dram, iedm2023_dram}. 
Such approaches aim to overcome cell aspect ratio limits, though integration complexity and refresh overhead remain unresolved.
