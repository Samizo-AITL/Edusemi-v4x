DRAM technology has continually advanced through cell capacitor scaling, high-k dielectrics, and process innovations. 
Recent works highlight the difficulty of maintaining capacitance while suppressing leakage currents in deep sub-20 nm technologies \cite{choi2022}.
Furthermore, the industry is exploring 3D DRAM architectures to extend scaling, analogous to NAND flash, by stacking capacitor arrays \cite{kim2021_dram}.
Such approaches aim to overcome cell aspect ratio limits, though integration complexity and refresh overhead remain unresolved.
