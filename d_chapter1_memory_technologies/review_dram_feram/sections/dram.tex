DRAM technology has continually advanced through cell capacitor scaling, high-$k$ dielectrics, and process innovations. 
Recent works highlight the difficulty of maintaining capacitance while suppressing leakage currents in deep sub-20 nm technologies~\cite{choi2022}. 
Furthermore, the industry is exploring 3D DRAM architectures to extend scaling, analogous to NAND flash, by stacking capacitor arrays~\cite{kim2021_dram, iedm2023_dram}. 
Such approaches aim to overcome cell aspect ratio limits, though integration complexity and refresh overhead remain unresolved.
Recent progress in 3D DRAM architectures~\cite{kim2021_dram, iedm2023_dram} highlights vertical capacitor stacking 
as a pathway beyond sub-1z scaling. 
However, challenges in leakage suppression and cell aspect ratio remain unresolved~\cite{lee2020_dram}.
