DRAM technology has continually advanced through cell capacitor scaling, high-$k$ dielectrics, and process innovations. The industry roadmap has focused on maintaining capacitance while suppressing leakage currents in deep sub-20 nm technologies \cite{choi2022}. 

Emerging approaches include 3D DRAM architectures to extend scaling, analogous to NAND flash, by stacking capacitor arrays \cite{kim2021_dram,iedm2023_dram}. Such approaches aim to overcome cell aspect ratio limits, though integration complexity and refresh overhead remain unresolved. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:dram_evolution} illustrates the structural evolution of DRAM cells from planar to trench, high-aspect ratio, and 3D-stacked designs. These strategies highlight vertical capacitor stacking as a pathway to sustain sub-1z scaling, although challenges such as leakage suppression and refresh overhead remain \cite{iedm2023_dram}.
