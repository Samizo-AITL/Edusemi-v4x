DRAM employs a 1T1C cell with a 6$F^2$ footprint. Continuous scaling has demanded extreme aspect-ratio capacitors, aggressive high-$k$ dielectrics, and careful control of leakage and refresh power. Reliability concerns include retention failures, soft errors, and aging (e.g., BTI/HCI) effects. Recent IEDM reports discuss roadmap items such as 3D DRAM concepts and material/process innovations for deep sub-20\,nm nodes.
