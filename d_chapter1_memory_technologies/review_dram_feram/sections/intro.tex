Memory hierarchies are critical to modern computing systems. 
DRAM remains the dominant volatile memory owing to its high speed, density, and scalability~\cite{choi2022, kim2021_dram}. 
However, DRAM scaling faces fundamental challenges as the capacitor dimensions approach physical limits, particularly in sub-1z nodes~\cite{lee2020_dram, iedm2023_dram}. 
In parallel, ferroelectric HfO$_2$-based memories (FeRAM/FeFET) have emerged as promising non-volatile candidates, combining CMOS compatibility with fast switching~\cite{boscke2011, mueller2012}. 
This review targets researchers and practitioners by consolidating recent results from IEDM, VLSI, and IEEE journals, while exploring hybrid perspectives that may reshape the volatileâ€“non-volatile boundary.
