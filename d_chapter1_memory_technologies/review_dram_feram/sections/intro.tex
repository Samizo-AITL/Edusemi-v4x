Memory hierarchies are critical to modern computing systems. DRAM remains the dominant volatile memory owing to its high speed and scalability, whereas FeRAM (including FeFET-based cells) offers non-volatility with competitive speed. This review targets researchers and practitioners by consolidating recent results from IEDM/VLSI and IEEE journals, and by proposing a hybrid perspective that redefines the boundary between volatile and non-volatile memory.
