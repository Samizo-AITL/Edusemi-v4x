Memory hierarchies are critical to modern computing systems. 
DRAM remains the dominant volatile memory owing to its high speed and scalability~\cite{choi2022, iedm2023_dram}. 
Alternatively, ferroelectric HfO$_2$-based memories offer non-volatility with competitive speed~\cite{boscke2011, noheda2023}.
