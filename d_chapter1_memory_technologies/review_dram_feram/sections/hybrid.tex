Hybrid memory hierarchies have gained significant attention, aiming to exploit the high speed of DRAM together with the non-volatility of FeRAM and other emerging memories~\cite{itrs2022, samsung2021}. 
System-level perspectives envision FeRAM as near-memory storage or NVDIMM-like solutions, reducing refresh energy and enabling instant-on functionality. 
Such architectures may also support AI edge computing and in-memory acceleration, where FeFET-based devices provide low-power and non-volatile synaptic elements~\cite{schaller2021_ai}. 
However, trade-offs in endurance, variability, and cost remain barriers to widespread adoption.
Hybrid memory hierarchies may also integrate PCM, MRAM, and RRAM alongside FeRAM~\cite{itrs2022, samsung2021}. 
These alternatives offer complementary trade-offs in endurance and scalability, 
but none have yet matched the combined speed and CMOS-compatibility of FeFETs~\cite{schaller2021_ai}.
