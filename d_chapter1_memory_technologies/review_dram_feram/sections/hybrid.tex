Hybrid hierarchies aim to pair DRAM speed with FeRAM non volatility. Placing FeRAM near the memory controller can reduce refresh energy and enable instant on and fast checkpointing.

Benefits: reduced refresh traffic, quick persistence, and improved crash consistency.

Constraints: FeRAM write energy is higher than DRAM, endurance is lower than refresh activity, and process integration adds risk.

System design ideas: tiering policies for cold or persistent data, refresh co optimization for DRAM regions, and controller telemetry for wear and retention aware placement.
