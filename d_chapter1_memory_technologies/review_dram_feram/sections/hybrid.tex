Hybrid hierarchies may leverage DRAM as the high-speed working set while deploying FeRAM as a near-memory non-volatile tier or NVDIMM-like layer. System-level implications include refresh-energy reduction, fast checkpointing, and resilience. Competition and complementarity with MRAM, ReRAM, PCM, and FeFET variants are also discussed in the context of endurance and energy constraints.
